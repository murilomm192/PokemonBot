# Pokemon Info TelegramBot

Did you ever fell frustraded while you where playing a Pokemon game after 10 years and you could not remember what type a pokemon was? Poison is weak against Grass? Excuse me, there is a type Fairy now?

I felt exactly like this and went and made a telegram bot to help me remenber.

### How to use

Type the name of a pokemon and the bot will return it's stats and the type relationships (even if the weakness is 2x or 4x)

Send a picture and the bot will do a reverse image search and find you pokemon and return its infos, works even with spites in pictures snaps directly from the games.

Enjoy!
